<h1>Our Privacy Policy</h1>

<h2>Revisions to this Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>Any information that is collected via our Services is covered by the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected. We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we'll notify you of those changes by posting them on the Services or by sending you an email or other notification, and we'll update the "Last Updated Date" above to indicate when those changes will become effective.</p>

<h2>Collection and Use of Information</h2>

<h3>Information Collected or Received from You</h3>

<p>Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services, to administer your use of the Services (including your Account, if you are an Account holder), and to enable you to enjoy and easily navigate our Services.</p>

<h3>Account Information.</h3>

<p>If you create an Account, we'll collect certain information that can be used to identify you, such as your name and email address ("PII"). If you create an Account using your login credentials from your FB Account, we'll be able to access and collect your name and email address and other PII that your privacy settings on your FB Account permit us to access. We may also collect your gender, age or date of birth, zip code and other information that is not considered PII because it cannot be used by itself to identify you.</p>

<h3>Information Related to Use of the Services.</h3>

<p>Our servers automatically record certain information about how a person uses our Services (we refer to this information as "Log Data"), including both Account holders and non-Account holders (either, a "User"). Log Data may include information such as a User's Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, the web page that a User was visiting before accessing our Services, the pages or features of our Services to which a User browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links on our Services that a User clicked on and other statistics. We use Log Data to administer the Services and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) Log Data to improve, customize and enhance our Services by expanding their features and functionality and tailoring them to our Users' needs and preferences.</p>

<h3>Apple HealthKit.</h3>

<p>If you choose to provide us with access to certain PII stored by Apple HealthKit, we can access and collect that PII. The PII to which we have access is controlled by your privacy settings with Apple HealthKit. We use data from Apple HealthKit to improve our Services to you (such as improving our recommendations for meditations for you) and to track your activity.</p>

<h3>Information Sent by Your Mobile Device.</h3>

<p>We collect certain information that your mobile device sends when you use our Services, like a device identifier, user settings and the operating system of your device, as well as information about your use of our Services.</p>

<h3>Location Information.</h3>

<p>When you use our App, we may collect and store information about your location by converting your IP address into a rough geo-location or by accessing your mobile device's GPS coordinates or coarse location if you enable location services on your device. We may use location information to improve and personalize our Services for you. If you do not want us to collect location information, you may disable that feature on your mobile device.</p>

<h2>Information that We Share with Third Parties</h2>

<p>We will not share any PII that we have collected from or regarding you except as described below:</p>

<h3>Information Shared with Our Services Providers.</h3>

<p>We may engage third-party services providers to work with us to administer and provide the Services. These third-party services providers have access to your PII only for the purpose of performing services on our behalf and are expressly obligated not to disclose or use your PII for any other purpose.</p>

<h3>Information Shared with Apple HealthKit.</h3>

<p>If you instruct us to do so, we will share certain of your information with Apple HealthKit. Before you instruct us to share your information with Apple HealthKit, please review the Apple privacy policy because any information that we share with the Apple HealthKit app will become subject to Apple's privacy policy. In addition, please be careful about allowing other users of Apple HealthKit to access your information through that service. We use information obtained through Apple HealthKit only for the purpose of providing health-related content in connection with the App. We does not disclose to third parties any information collected from Apple HealthKit except as otherwise explained in this Privacy Policy (such as disclosing information on an anonymized and aggregated basis or to third-party services providers who have access to your PII only for the purpose of performing services on our behalf and are expressly obligated not to disclose or use your PII for any other purpose). We do not disclose or sell any information shared by Apple HealthKit to third party advertisers, data brokers, or information resellers.</p>

<h2>Information Shared with Other Third Parties.</h2>

<p>We may share your PII, as well as aggregated information and non-identifying information, with third parties for industry research and analysis, demographic profiling and other similar purposes.</p>

<h3>Information Disclosed in Connection with Business Transactions.</h3>

<p>Information that we collect from our users, including PII, is considered to be a business asset. Thus, if we are acquired by a third party as a result of a transaction such as a merger, acquisition or asset sale or if our assets are acquired by a third party in the event we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, some or all of our assets, including your PII, may be disclosed or transferred to a third party acquirer in connection with the transaction.</p>

<h3>Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others.</h3>

<p>We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate: (a) to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas) (b) to protect our property, rights and safety and the property, rights and safety of a third party or the public in general and (c) to stop any activity that we consider illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.</p>

<h2>Your Choices</h2>

<p>We offer you choices regarding the collection, use and sharing of your PII and we'll respect the choices you make. Please note that if you decide not to provide us with the PII that we request, you may not be able to access all of the features of the Services.</p>

<h3>Opt-Out.</h3>

<p>We may periodically send you free newsletters and e-mails that directly promote our Services. When you receive such promotional communications from us, you will have the opportunity to "opt-out" (either through your Account or by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the e-mail you receive). We do need to send you certain communications regarding the Services and you will not be able to opt out of those communications - e.g., communications regarding updates to our Terms of Service or this Privacy Policy or information about billing.</p>

<h3>Modifying Your Information.</h3>

<p>You can access and modify the PII associated with your Account by changing the Settings in the App or contacting us at mobilehabit@gmail.com. If you want us to delete your PII and your Account, please contact us at mobilehabit@gmail.com with your request. We'll take steps to delete your information as soon we can, but some information may remain in archived/backup copies for our records or as otherwise required by law.</p>

<h2>The Security of Your Information</h2>

<p>We take reasonable administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect the information that we collect from or about you (including your PII) from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Please be aware, however, that no method of transmitting information over the Internet or storing information is completely secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any information.</p>

<h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>

<p>Our Services may contain links to websites and services that are owned or operated by third parties (each, a "Third-Party Service"). Any information that you provide on or to a Third-Party Service or that is collected by a Third-party Service is provided directly to the owner or operator of the Third-party Service and is subject to the owner's or operator's privacy policy. We're not responsible for the content, privacy or security practices and policies of any Third-party Service. To protect your information we recommend that you carefully review the privacy policies of all Third-party Services that you access.</p>

<h2>International Transfer</h2>

<p>Your PII may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you're located outside the United States and choose to provide your PII to us, we may transfer your PII to the United States and process it there.</p>

<h2>Our Policy Towards Children</h2>

<p>Our Services are not directed to children under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect PII from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have collected PII of a child under age 13 we will take steps to delete such information from our files as soon as possible.</p>
